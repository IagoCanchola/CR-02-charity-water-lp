        <h2>The Impact: <strong>Maya Devi</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Maya Devi is a proud mother of four who lives in a rural village in Nepal. For years, she struggled to provide her family with clean water, often walking miles to collect water from a contaminated source. Thanks to the support of donors like you, Maya now has access to clean water right in her village. This has transformed her family's health and future, allowing her children to thrive and attend school regularly.
